# Tea Cozy project
A simple website landing page for a fictional Tea Cozy Store. This is a codecademy project.

## Description
This is a codecademy project to design a simple website for a fictional store. The website is built off of a design spec, which can be found in the resources folder, and is built entirely in HTML and CSS. The project is meant to teach basic layout and design ideas, such as the navigation bar, use of background images and flexbox.

## Skills Used
As well as teaching basic CSS design and layout principles, this project allowed practice of the basic Git workflow. The project repo was created on Github, and then a local clone was made before any code was written. As a reminder, the basic workflow involves:
* pulling updates from the server,
* creating a new branch to work on locally,
* writing new code in the newly-created branch,
* pushing changes to the remote,
* and finally, creating a pull request and merging the changes back into *main*.
